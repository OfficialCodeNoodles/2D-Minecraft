# 2D Minecraft

Have you ever wanted a worse version of both Minecraft and Terraria? Well if so, this is the game for you!

## What exactly is this game?

This program is a 2D version of Minecraft written in C++, and it uses the graphics library SFML, as well as my own UI library named Glass. Most of the gameplay is pretty similiar to regular Minecraft, but some things have been adjusted to work in 2D.

## Are there any new features?

Yes. This game features walls. This allows you to block light and decorate an area without it blocking anything on the block layer.

## Notes

This game is extremely unfinished and buggy, so treat this as an experiment. This game also only works on Windows right now, but I may build it for other operating systems later on.

Also, there are a variety of debug controls that are in the game:

- F4: Change lighting style
- F5: Disable lighting
- F6: Change framerate
- F7: Enter "creative mode". You are invincible, can fly, and can place down whatever tiles you want to (scroll the mouse to change the tile selected)
- F8: Advance time of day
- F11: Enter/exit fullscreen (if the window is the wrong size, you may have to exit fullscreen to get it to work correctly)
